To resolve the bug, we need to replace the expression '// BUG //' with the correct code. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the bug is related to the condition `p->key == 0 || p->key == key`. This condition checks if the key in the current node is either 0 or equal to the key we want to insert. If this condition is true, we update the current node with the new key-value pair. Otherwise, we need to insert the new key-value pair into a leaf node.

To fix the bug, we can replace the code between the '// BUG //' expressions with the following code:

``` C
if (p->key == 0 || p->key == key) {
	PM_EQU(p, &e);
	pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));
} else {
	ctree_map_insert_leaf(pop, &D_RW(map)->root, e,
			find_crit_bit(p->key, key));
}
```

This code updates the current node with the new key-value pair if the condition is true. Otherwise, it calls the `ctree_map_insert_leaf` function to insert the new key-value pair into a leaf node.

Here's the corrected code:

``` C
/*
 * ctree_map_insert -- inserts a new key-value pair into the map
 */
int
ctree_map_insert(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct ctree_map) map,
	uint64_t key, PMEMoid value)
{
	struct tree_map_entry *p = &D_RW(map)->root;
	int ret = 0;

	/* descend the path until a best matching key is found */
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node;
	while (!OID_IS_NULL(p->slot) &&
		OID_INSTANCEOF(p->slot, struct tree_map_node)) {
		TOID_ASSIGN(node, p->slot);
		p = &D_RW(node)->entries[BIT_IS_SET(key, D_RW(node)->diff)];
	}

	struct tree_map_entry e = {key, value};
	TX_BEGIN(pop) {
		if (p->key == 0 || p->key == key) {
			PM_EQU(p, &e);
			pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));
		} else {
			ctree_map_insert_leaf(pop, &D_RW(map)->root, e,
					find_crit_bit(p->key, key));
		}
	} TX_ONABORT {
		ret = 1;
	} TX_END

	// not needed for now
	// printf("ret = %d\n", ret);
	return ret;
}
```

Now the bug should be fixed, and the program should work as expected.
