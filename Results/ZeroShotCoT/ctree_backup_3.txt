To resolve the bug, we need to fix the code inside the `TX_BEGIN` and `TX_END` blocks. 

The first bug is located at the beginning of the `TX_BEGIN` block. We need to initialize the `p` variable with the correct value. Currently, it is initialized with `&D_RW(map)->root`, but it should be initialized with `D_RW(map)->root`. 

The second bug is located at the end of the `TX_BEGIN` block. We need to call the `ctree_map_insert_leaf` function with the correct arguments. Currently, it is called with `&D_RW(map)->root`, but it should be called with `p`. 

Here is the corrected code:

``` C
/*
 * ctree_map_insert -- inserts a new key-value pair into the map
 */
int
ctree_map_insert(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct ctree_map) map,
	uint64_t key, PMEMoid value)
{
	struct tree_map_entry *p = D_RW(map)->root;
	int ret = 0;

	/* descend the path until a best matching key is found */
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node;
	while (!OID_IS_NULL(p->slot) &&
		OID_INSTANCEOF(p->slot, struct tree_map_node)) {
		TOID_ASSIGN(node, p->slot);
		p = &D_RW(node)->entries[BIT_IS_SET(key, D_RW(node)->diff)];
	}

	struct tree_map_entry e = {key, value};
	TX_BEGIN(pop) {
		if (p->key == 0 || p->key == key) {
			PM_EQU(*p, e);
			pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));
		} else {
			ctree_map_insert_leaf(p, e,
					find_crit_bit(p->key, key));
		}
	} TX_ONABORT {
		ret = 1;
	} TX_END

	// not needed for now
	// printf("ret = %d\n", ret);
	return ret;
}
```

Please note that this correction assumes that the `D_RW` macro is correctly defined and that the `ctree_map_insert_leaf` and `find_crit_bit` functions are implemented correctly.
