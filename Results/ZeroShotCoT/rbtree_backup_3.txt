To resolve the bug, we need to understand what the code is trying to achieve. It seems that the code is performing a left/right rotation around a node in a red-black tree. 

The bug is located between the two "// BUG //" comments. Let's analyze the code in that section:

``` C
PM_EQU(NODE_P(child), NODE_P(node));
// TX_SET(NODE_P(node), slots[NODE_LOCATION(node)], child);
PM_EQU(D_RW(NODE_P(node))->slots[NODE_LOCATION(node)], child);
```

It seems that the intention is to update the parent pointer of the child node to point to the parent node. However, the code is using the `PM_EQU` macro, which is not a valid function or macro in the PMDK library.

To fix this bug, we need to replace the `PM_EQU` macro with the correct function or macro that updates the parent pointer of the child node.

Let's assume that the correct function or macro to update the parent pointer is `PM_SET`. We can replace the buggy code with the following:

``` C
PM_SET(D_RW(NODE_P(child))->parent, NODE_P(node));
```

This code will update the parent pointer of the child node to point to the parent node.

Now, let's analyze the second bug:

``` C
// BUG //
```

It seems that there is a missing code block between the two "// BUG //" comments. We need to add the missing code block to complete the left/right rotation.

To fix this bug, we need to add the missing code block that updates the parent pointer of the node to point to the child node. Let's assume that the correct function or macro to update the parent pointer is `PM_SET`. We can add the missing code block as follows:

``` C
PM_SET(D_RW(node)->parent, child);
```

This code will update the parent pointer of the node to point to the child node.

Now, let's put it all together and present the corrected program:

``` C
/*
 * rbtree_map_rotate -- (internal) performs a left/right rotation around a node
 */
static void
rbtree_map_rotate(TOID(struct rbtree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node, enum rb_children c)
{
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;
	
	TX_ADD(node);
	TX_ADD(child);

	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);

	if (!TOID_EQUALS(D_RO(child)->slots[c], s))
		TX_SET(D_RW(child)->slots[c], parent, node);
		
	PM_SET(D_RW(NODE_P(child))->parent, NODE_P(node));
	PM_SET(D_RW(node)->parent, child);
}
```

This corrected program should resolve the bugs and perform the left/right rotation correctly.
