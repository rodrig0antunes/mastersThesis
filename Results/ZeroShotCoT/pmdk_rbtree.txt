To resolve the bug, we need to analyze the code and understand what it is supposed to do. 

In the function `rbtree_map_rotate`, the bug is located in the code block delimited by `// BUG#1 //`. Let's analyze this code block:

```C
PM_EQU(NODE_P(child), NODE_P(node));

TX_ADD(NODE_P(node));
PM_EQU(NODE_PARENT_AT(node, NODE_LOCATION(node)), child);


PM_EQU(D_RW(child)->slots[c], node);
PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->parent, child);
```

From the code, it seems that the intention is to update the parent-child relationship between `node` and `child`. However, the bug is that the `NODE_P` macro is used incorrectly. 

To fix this bug, we need to replace `NODE_P(child)` with `NODE_PARENT_AT(child, NODE_LOCATION(child))` and replace `NODE_P(node)` with `NODE_PARENT_AT(node, NODE_LOCATION(node))`. 

The corrected code block should look like this:

```C
PM_EQU(NODE_PARENT_AT(child, NODE_LOCATION(child)), NODE_PARENT_AT(node, NODE_LOCATION(node)));

TX_ADD(NODE_PARENT_AT(node, NODE_LOCATION(node)));
PM_EQU(NODE_PARENT_AT(node, NODE_LOCATION(node)), child);


PM_EQU(D_RW(child)->slots[c], node);
PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->parent, child);
```

Now, let's move on to the next bug.
