To resolve the bug, we need to fix the code within the "// BUG //" section. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the bug is related to the assignment of the key and value to the new entry. The function `PMTest_assign` is being used to assign the key, but it is not a standard function and is likely causing the bug. 

To fix this, we can replace the line `PMTest_assign(&(D_RW(e)->key), sizeof(struct entry));` with a standard assignment statement `D_RW(e)->key = key;`. 

Similarly, we can replace the line `(D_RW(e)->value) = (value);` with `D_RW(e)->value = value;`. 

Here is the corrected code:

``` C
/*
 * hm_tx_insert -- inserts specified value into the hashmap,
 * returns:
 * - 0 if successful,
 * - 1 if value already existed,
 * - -1 if something bad happened
 */
int
hm_tx_insert(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct hashmap_tx) hashmap,
	uint64_t key, PMEMoid value)
{
	TOID(struct buckets) buckets = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets;
	TOID(struct entry) var;

	uint64_t h = hash(&hashmap, &buckets, key);
	int num = 0;

	for (var = D_RO(buckets)->bucket[h];
			!TOID_IS_NULL(var);
			var = D_RO(var)->next) {
		if (D_RO(var)->key == key)
			return 1;
		num++;
	}

	int ret = 0;
	TX_BEGIN(pop) {

		TX_ADD_FIELD(D_RO(hashmap)->buckets, bucket[h]);

		TX_ADD_FIELD(hashmap, count);
		TX_ADD_FIELD(hashmap, count);
		
		TOID(struct entry) e = TX_NEW(struct entry);
			
		D_RW(e)->key = key;
		D_RW(e)->value = value;
		D_RW(e)->next = D_RO(buckets)->bucket[h];
		
		D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h] = e;
		D_RW(hashmap)->count = D_RW(hashmap)->count + 1;
		num++;
	} TX_ONABORT {
		fprintf(stderr, "transaction aborted: %s\n",
			pmemobj_errormsg());
		ret = -1;
	} TX_END

	if (ret)
		return ret;

	if (num > MAX_HASHSET_THRESHOLD ||
			(num > MIN_HASHSET_THRESHOLD &&
			D_RO(hashmap)->count > 2 * D_RO(buckets)->nbuckets))
		hm_tx_rebuild(pop, hashmap, D_RO(buckets)->nbuckets * 2);

	return 0;
}
```

This should fix the bug in the code.
