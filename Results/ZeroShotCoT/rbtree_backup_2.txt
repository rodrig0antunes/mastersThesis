To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue in the code. Since the code is not provided, we can analyze the bug detection tool's output to understand the problem.

Based on the code snippet provided, it seems that the bug detection tool has identified two bugs in the code. The first bug is located between the two "// BUG //" comments, and the second bug is also located after the second "// BUG //" comment.

To resolve the first bug, we need to determine what the issue is. Without the code, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact problem. However, based on the context, it seems that the bug might be related to the use of the macro `PM_EQU`. It is possible that the macro is not being used correctly or that it is causing some unexpected behavior.

To resolve the second bug, we need to analyze the code after the second "// BUG //" comment. Again, without the code, it is difficult to determine the exact issue. However, based on the context, it seems that the bug might be related to the use of the `TX_SET` function. It is possible that the function is not being used correctly or that it is causing some unexpected behavior.

To provide a more accurate solution, we would need the complete code and the specific error messages or behavior observed.
