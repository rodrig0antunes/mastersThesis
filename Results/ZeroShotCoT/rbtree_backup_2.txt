To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue in the code. Since the code is not provided, we can analyze the bug detection tool's output to understand the problem.

Based on the code snippet provided, it seems that the bug detection tool has identified two bugs in the code. The first bug is located between the two "// BUG //" comments, and the second bug is also located after the second "// BUG //" comment.

To resolve the first bug, we need to add a transactional context around the code that modifies the persistent memory. In this case, we need to add a transactional context around the line `PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);`.

To resolve the second bug, we need to add a transactional context around the code that modifies the persistent memory. In this case, we need to add a transactional context around the line `TX_SET(D_RW(child)->slots[c], parent, node);`.

Let's update the code to include the necessary transactional contexts and fix the bugs:

``` C
/*
 * rbtree_map_rotate -- (internal) performs a left/right rotation around a node
 */
static void
rbtree_map_rotate(TOID(struct rbtree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node, enum rb_children c)
{
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;
		
	// BUG //
	TX_BEGIN(map) {
		TX_ADD(node);
		PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);
	} TX_END

	if (!TOID_EQUALS(D_RO(child)->slots[c], s)) {
		// BUG //
		TX_BEGIN(map) {
			TX_SET(D_RW(child)->slots[c], parent, node);
		} TX_END
	}

	PM_EQU(NODE_P(child), NODE_P(node));

	TX_BEGIN(map) {
		TX_SET(NODE_P(node), slots[NODE_LOCATION(node)], child);
		PM_EQU(D_RW(child)->slots[c], node);
		PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->parent, child);
	} TX_END
}
```

In the updated code, we have added transactional contexts using `TX_BEGIN` and `TX_END` around the code that modifies the persistent memory. This ensures that the modifications are atomic and durable.

Please note that the `map` parameter is used as the transactional context in the `TX_BEGIN` and `TX_END` blocks. Make sure to replace `map` with the appropriate transactional context based on your program's design.

This should resolve the bugs in the code.
