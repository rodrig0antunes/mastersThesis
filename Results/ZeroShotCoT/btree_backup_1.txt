To resolve the bug, we need to fix the code within the "// BUG //" section. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the bug is related to the assignment of the new root node. The code is currently assigning the new root node to the variable "up", but it is not updating the root node of the map to point to the new root node.

To fix this, we need to update the line "// BUG //" to assign the new root node to the "root" field of the map. 

Here is the corrected code:

``` C
/* 
* btree_map_find_dest_node -- (internal) finds a place to insert the new key at 
*/
static TOID(struct tree_map_node)
btree_map_find_dest_node(TOID(struct btree_map) map,
TOID(struct tree_map_node) n, TOID(struct tree_map_node) parent,
uint64_t key, int *p)
{
if (D_RO(n)->n == BTREE_ORDER - 1) { /* node is full, perform a split */
struct tree_map_node_item m;
TOID(struct tree_map_node) right =
btree_map_create_split_node(n, &m);

if (!TOID_IS_NULL(parent)) {
btree_map_insert_node(parent, *p, m, n, right);
if (key > m.key) /* select node to continue search */
n = right;
} else { /* replacing root node, the tree grows in height */
TOID(struct tree_map_node) up =
TX_ZNEW(struct tree_map_node);
PM_EQU(D_RW(up)->n, 1);
PM_EQU(D_RW(up)->items[0], m);
PM_EQU(D_RW(up)->slots[0], n);
PM_EQU(D_RW(up)->slots[1], right);

// BUG //
PM_EQU(D_RW(map)->root, up);
n = up;

// BUG //
}

}

int i;
for (i = 0; i < BTREE_ORDER - 1; ++i) {
*p = i;

/* 
* The key either fits somewhere in the middle or at the 
* right edge of the node. 
*/
if (D_RO(n)->n == i || D_RO(n)->items[i].key > key) {
return TOID_IS_NULL(D_RO(n)->slots[i]) ? n :
btree_map_find_dest_node(map,
D_RO(n)->slots[i], n, key, p);
}
}

/* 
* The key is bigger than the last node element, go one level deeper 
* in the rightmost child. 
*/
return btree_map_find_dest_node(map, D_RO(n)->slots[i], n, key, p);
}
```

This should fix the bug and correctly update the root node of the map.
