The bug in the code is that the assignment `PM_EQU(D_RW(map)->root, up);` is not being persisted to the persistent memory. This means that the change to the root node is not being saved and will be lost when the program exits.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `pmemobj_tx_add_range()` function to add the assignment to the transaction. This will ensure that the change is persisted to the persistent memory.

Here is the corrected code:

``` C
/*
 * btree_map_find_dest_node -- (internal) finds a place to insert the new key at
 */
static TOID(struct tree_map_node)
btree_map_find_dest_node(TOID(struct btree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) n, TOID(struct tree_map_node) parent,
	uint64_t key, int *p)
{
	if (D_RO(n)->n == BTREE_ORDER - 1) { /* node is full, perform a split */
		struct tree_map_node_item m;
		TOID(struct tree_map_node) right =
			btree_map_create_split_node(n, &m);

		if (!TOID_IS_NULL(parent)) {
			btree_map_insert_node(parent, *p, m, n, right);
			if (key > m.key) /* select node to continue search */
				n = right;
		} else { /* replacing root node, the tree grows in height */
			TOID(struct tree_map_node) up =
				TX_ZNEW(struct tree_map_node);
			PM_EQU(D_RW(up)->n, 1);
			PM_EQU(D_RW(up)->items[0], m);
			PM_EQU(D_RW(up)->slots[0], n);
			PM_EQU(D_RW(up)->slots[1], right);

			// BUG //
			pmemobj_tx_add_range(map.oid, offsetof(struct btree_map, root), sizeof(map->root));
			PM_EQU(D_RW(map)->root, up);
			n = up;
			// BUG //
		}
	}

	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < BTREE_ORDER - 1; ++i) {
		*p = i;

		/*
		 * The key either fits somewhere in the middle or at the
		 * right edge of the node.
		 */
		if (D_RO(n)->n == i || D_RO(n)->items[i].key > key) {
			return TOID_IS_NULL(D_RO(n)->slots[i]) ? n :
				btree_map_find_dest_node(map,
					D_RO(n)->slots[i], n, key, p);
		}
	}

	/*
	 * The key is bigger than the last node element, go one level deeper
	 * in the rightmost child.
	 */
	return btree_map_find_dest_node(map, D_RO(n)->slots[i], n, key, p);
}
```

In the corrected code, we added the line `pmemobj_tx_add_range(map.oid, offsetof(struct btree_map, root), sizeof(map->root));` before the assignment `PM_EQU(D_RW(map)->root, up);`. This line adds the range of memory containing the `root` field of the `map` object to the transaction, ensuring that the assignment is persisted to the persistent memory.

Now the assignment to the `root` field will be persisted correctly and the bug will be fixed.
