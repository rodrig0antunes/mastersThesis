To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue and provide a fix. 

Looking at the code, the first bug is located at the line:

```C
TOID(struct tree_map_node) sb = NODE_PARENT_AT(n, !c); /* sibling */
```

The bug is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the context, it seems that the user intended to access the parent node of `n` and assign it to `sb`. However, the code is using the `NODE_PARENT_AT` macro, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. To fix this bug, we can replace the line with:

```C
TOID(struct tree_map_node) sb = D_RO(NODE_P(n))->slots[!c]; /* sibling */
```

This change will correctly assign the sibling node to `sb` by accessing the parent node `NODE_P(n)` and then accessing the appropriate slot based on the `!c` condition.

The second bug is located at the line:

```C
if (D_RO(D_RO(sb)->slots[RB_RIGHT])->color == COLOR_BLACK &&
    D_RO(D_RO(sb)->slots[RB_LEFT])->color == COLOR_BLACK) {
```

The bug is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the context, it seems that the user intended to check the color of the right and left child nodes of `sb`. However, the code is using `D_RO` twice, which is unnecessary. To fix this bug, we can replace the line with:

```C
if (D_RO(sb)->slots[RB_RIGHT]->color == COLOR_BLACK &&
    D_RO(sb)->slots[RB_LEFT]->color == COLOR_BLACK) {
```

This change will correctly check the color of the right and left child nodes of `sb` without unnecessary `D_RO` calls.

Now, let's present the corrected code:

```C
/*
 * rbtree_map_repair_branch -- (internal) restores red-black tree in one branch
 */
static TOID(struct tree_map_node)
rbtree_map_repair_branch(TOID(struct rbtree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) n, enum rb_children c)
{

	// BUG //

	TOID(struct tree_map_node) sb = D_RO(NODE_P(n))->slots[!c]; /* sibling */
	if (D_RO(sb)->color == COLOR_RED) {
		PM_EQU(D_RW(sb)->color, COLOR_BLACK);
		TX_SET(NODE_P(n), color, COLOR_RED);
		rbtree_map_rotate(map, NODE_P(n), c);
		sb = D_RO(NODE_P(n))->slots[!c];
		
		// BUG //
		
	}

	if (D_RO(sb)->slots[RB_RIGHT]->color == COLOR_BLACK &&
		D_RO(sb)->slots[RB_LEFT]->color == COLOR_BLACK) {
		TX_SET(sb, color, COLOR_RED);
		return D_RO(n)->parent;
	} else {
		if (D_RO(sb)->slots[!c]->color == COLOR_BLACK) {
			TX_SET(D_RW(sb)->slots[c], color, COLOR_BLACK);
			TX_SET(sb, color, COLOR_RED);
			rbtree_map_rotate(map, sb, !c);
			sb = D_RO(NODE_P(n))->slots[!c];
		}
		TX_SET(sb, color, D_RO(NODE_P(n))->color);
		TX_SET(NODE_P(n), color, COLOR_BLACK);
		TX_SET(D_RW(sb)->slots[!c], color, COLOR_BLACK);
		rbtree_map_rotate(map, NODE_P(n), c);

		return RB_FIRST(map);
	}

	return n;
}
```
