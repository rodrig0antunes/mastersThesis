To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue and make the necessary corrections. 

Looking at the code, the first bug is located at the line:

```C
TOID(struct tree_map_node) sb = NODE_PARENT_AT(n, !c); /* sibling */
```

To fix this bug, we need to replace `NODE_PARENT_AT` with `NODE_PARENT`. 

The corrected code will be:

```C
TOID(struct tree_map_node) sb = NODE_PARENT(n); /* sibling */
```

Now, let's move on to the second bug. It is located at the line:

```C
sb = NODE_PARENT_AT(n, !c);
```

To fix this bug, we need to replace `NODE_PARENT_AT` with `NODE_PARENT`. 

The corrected code will be:

```C
sb = NODE_PARENT(n);
```

Now, let's put the whole corrected program together.
