To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue in the code and make the necessary corrections. 

Looking at the code, the first bug is located at the line:

```C
if (TOID_IS_NULL(D_RO(node)->slots[0])) { /* leaf */
```

The bug is not clearly specified, but we can assume that the issue is related to the condition check. 

The second bug is located at the line:

```C
PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->items[p], EMPTY_ITEM);
```

Again, the bug is not clearly specified, but we can assume that the issue is related to the assignment of `EMPTY_ITEM` to `D_RW(node)->items[p]`.

To resolve these bugs, we can make the following corrections:

```C
if (D_RO(node)->n == 1 || p == BTREE_ORDER - 2) {
    PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->items[p], EMPTY_ITEM);
    PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[p], TOID_NULL(struct tree_map_node));
}
```

Here, we are checking if `D_RO(node)->n` is equal to 1 or if `p` is equal to `BTREE_ORDER - 2`. If either of these conditions is true, we assign `EMPTY_ITEM` to `D_RW(node)->items[p]` and set `D_RW(node)->slots[p]` to `TOID_NULL(struct tree_map_node)`.

Now, let's correct the code and present the whole corrected program:

```C
/*
 * btree_map_remove_from_node -- (internal) removes element from node
 */
static void
btree_map_remove_from_node(TOID(struct btree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) parent, int p)
{

	// BUG //
	if (TOID_IS_NULL(D_RO(node)->slots[0])) { /* leaf */

		if (D_RO(node)->n == 1 || p == BTREE_ORDER - 2) {
			PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->items[p], EMPTY_ITEM);
			PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[p], TOID_NULL(struct tree_map_node));
		}
		
		// BUG //

		else if (D_RO(node)->n != 1) {
			PM_MEMMOVE(&D_RW(node)->items[p],
				&D_RW(node)->items[p + 1],
				sizeof(struct tree_map_node_item) *
				(D_RO(node)->n - p));
		}

		PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->n, D_RO(node)->n - 1);
		return;
	}

	/* can't delete from non-leaf nodes, remove successor */
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) rchild = D_RW(node)->slots[p + 1];
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) lp = node;
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) lm =
		btree_map_get_leftmost_leaf(map, rchild, &lp);

	TX_ADD_FIELD(node, items[p]);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->items[p], D_RO(lm)->items[0]);

	btree_map_remove_from_node(map, lm, lp, 0);

	if (D_RO(lm)->n < BTREE_MIN) /* right child can be deficient now */
		btree_map_rebalance(map, lm, lp,
			TOID_EQUALS(lp, node) ? p + 1 : 0);
}
```

Please note that this is a suggested correction based on the assumption of the bugs. If the bug detection tool provides more specific information about the issues, please provide that information so that we can make more accurate corrections.
