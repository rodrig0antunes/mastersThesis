To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue in the code and make the necessary corrections. 

Looking at the code, the bug seems to be related to the condition `if (TOID_IS_NULL(D_RO(node)->slots[0]))`. This condition checks if the node is a leaf node by checking if the first slot is NULL. However, the bug is that it should be checking if the last slot is NULL instead.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to `if (TOID_IS_NULL(D_RO(node)->slots[D_RO(node)->n]))`. This will correctly check if the last slot is NULL, indicating that the node is a leaf node.

Here's the corrected code:

``` C
/*
 * btree_map_remove_from_node -- (internal) removes element from node
 */
static void
btree_map_remove_from_node(TOID(struct btree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) parent, int p)
{

	// BUG //
	if (TOID_IS_NULL(D_RO(node)->slots[D_RO(node)->n])) { /* leaf */

		if (D_RO(node)->n == 1 || p == BTREE_ORDER - 2)
			PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->items[p], EMPTY_ITEM);
		else if (D_RO(node)->n != 1) {
			PM_MEMMOVE(&D_RW(node)->items[p],
				&D_RW(node)->items[p + 1],
				sizeof(struct tree_map_node_item) *
				(D_RO(node)->n - p));
		}

		PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->n, D_RO(node)->n - 1);
		return;
	}

	/* can't delete from non-leaf nodes, remove successor */
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) rchild = D_RW(node)->slots[p + 1];
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) lp = node;
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) lm =
		btree_map_get_leftmost_leaf(map, rchild, &lp);

	TX_ADD_FIELD(node, items[p]);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->items[p], D_RO(lm)->items[0]);

	btree_map_remove_from_node(map, lm, lp, 0);

	if (D_RO(lm)->n < BTREE_MIN) /* right child can be deficient now */
		btree_map_rebalance(map, lm, lp,
			TOID_EQUALS(lp, node) ? p + 1 : 0);
}
```

Now the bug has been fixed and the program should work as expected.
