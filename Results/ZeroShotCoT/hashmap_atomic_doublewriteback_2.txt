To resolve the bug, we need to fix the code inside the delimited area. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the bug is related to updating the count of the hashmap after removing an entry. The code tries to decrement the count by 1, but it is not done correctly.

To fix this, we need to update the count of the hashmap correctly. We can do this by using the atomic_fetch_sub function provided by the PMDK library. This function atomically subtracts a value from a variable and returns the original value.

Here's the corrected code:

``` C
/*
 * hm_atomic_remove -- removes specified value from the hashmap,
 * returns:
 * - 1 if successful,
 * - 0 if value didn't exist,
 * - -1 if something bad happened
 */
PMEMoid
hm_atomic_remove(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct hashmap_atomic) hashmap,
		uint64_t key)
{
	TOID(struct buckets) buckets = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets;
	TOID(struct entry) var;

	uint64_t h = hash(&hashmap, &buckets, key);
	POBJ_LIST_FOREACH(var, &D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h], list) {
		if (D_RO(var)->key == key)
			break;
	}

	if (TOID_IS_NULL(var))
		return OID_NULL;

	PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, 1);
	pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty,
			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));

	if (POBJ_LIST_REMOVE_FREE(pop, &D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h],
			var, list)) {
		fprintf(stderr, "list remove failed: %s\n",
			pmemobj_errormsg());
		return OID_NULL;
	}
		
	// Update the count of the hashmap correctly
	PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count, atomic_fetch_sub(&D_RW(hashmap)->count, 1));
	pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count,
			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

	PMTest_isPersistedBefore(&D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty), &D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

	PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, 0);
	pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty,
			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));

	if (D_RO(hashmap)->count < D_RO(buckets)->nbuckets)
		hm_atomic_rebuild(pop, hashmap, D_RO(buckets)->nbuckets / 2);

	PMTest_isPersistedBefore(&D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count), &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));

	PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));
	PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

	return D_RO(var)->value;
}
```

This should fix the bug and correctly update the count of the hashmap after removing an entry.
