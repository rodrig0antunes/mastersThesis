To resolve the bug, we need to replace the code between the "// BUG //" markers. 

The bug is related to the assignment of the `dest` variable. It should be assigned the address of the `parent` variable, not its value. 

Here's the corrected code:

``` C
/*
 * ctree_map_remove -- removes key-value pair from the map
 */
PMEMoid
ctree_map_remove(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct ctree_map) map, uint64_t key)
{
	struct tree_map_entry *parent = NULL;
	struct tree_map_entry *leaf = ctree_map_get_leaf(map, key, &parent);
	if (leaf == NULL)
		return OID_NULL;

	PMEMoid ret = leaf->slot;

	if (parent == NULL) { /* root */
		TX_BEGIN(pop) {
			pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(leaf, sizeof(*leaf));
			PM_EQU(leaf->key, 0);
			PM_EQU(leaf->slot, OID_NULL);
		} TX_END
	} else {
		/*
		 * In this situation:
		 *	 parent
		 *	/     \
		 *   LEFT   RIGHT
		 * there's no point in leaving the parent internal node
		 * so it's swapped with the remaining node and then also freed.
		 */
		TX_BEGIN(pop) {
				
			// BUG //
			struct tree_map_entry *dest = parent;
			TOID(struct tree_map_node) node;
			TOID_ASSIGN(node, parent->slot);
			PM_EQU(dest->key, D_RW(node)->entries[
				D_RO(node)->entries[0].key == leaf->key].key);
			PM_EQU(dest->slot, D_RW(node)->entries[
				D_RO(node)->entries[0].key == leaf->key].slot);
			// BUG //

			TX_FREE(node);
		} TX_END
	}

	return ret;
}
```

Now the bug has been fixed.
