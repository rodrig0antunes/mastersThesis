To resolve the bug, we need to fix the code inside the delimited area. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the bug is related to updating the `count` field of the `hashmap` struct. The code is trying to increment the `count` field by 1, but it is not done correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `PM_EQU` macro to update the `count` field. The correct code should be:

``` C
PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count, (D_RW(hashmap)->count + 1));
```

This will correctly increment the `count` field by 1.

Now, let's put the whole corrected program together.
