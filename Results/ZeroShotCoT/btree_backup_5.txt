To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue and fix it. The bug is located within the area delimited by the "// BUG //" comments. Let's analyze the code in that area to understand the problem and propose a solution.

The first issue is that the line `TX_ADD(parent);` is commented out. This line should be uncommented to add the parent object to the transaction. Uncommenting this line will ensure that any modifications made to the parent object are persistent.

The second issue is that the line `PM_EQU(D_RW(parent)->n, D_RO(parent)->n - 1);` is incorrect. This line is trying to decrease the value of `n` in the parent object by 1, but it is using the wrong syntax. The correct syntax to decrease the value of `n` by 1 is `D_RW(parent)->n -= 1;`.

To fix the bug, we need to uncomment the line `TX_ADD(parent);` and replace the line `PM_EQU(D_RW(parent)->n, D_RO(parent)->n - 1);` with `D_RW(parent)->n -= 1;`.

Here is the corrected code:

``` C
/* 
* btree_map_merge -- (internal) merges node and right sibling 
*/
static void
btree_map_merge(TOID(struct btree_map) map, TOID(struct tree_map_node) rn,
                TOID(struct tree_map_node) node,
                TOID(struct tree_map_node) parent, int p)
{
    struct tree_map_node_item sep = D_RO(parent)->items[p];

    TX_ADD(node);
    /* add separator to the deficient node */
    PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->items[D_RW(node)->n], sep);
    PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->n, D_RO(node)->n + 1);

    /* copy right sibling data to node */
    PM_MEMCPY(&D_RW(node)->items[D_RO(node)->n], D_RO(rn)->items,
              sizeof(struct tree_map_node_item) * D_RO(rn)->n);
    PM_MEMCPY(&D_RW(node)->slots[D_RO(node)->n], D_RO(rn)->slots,
              sizeof(TOID(struct tree_map_node)) * (D_RO(rn)->n + 1));

    PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->n, D_RO(node)->n + D_RO(rn)->n);

    TX_FREE(rn); /* right node is now empty */

    TX_ADD(parent);
    D_RW(parent)->n -= 1;

    /* move everything to the right of the separator by one array slot */
    PM_MEMMOVE(D_RW(parent)->items + p, D_RW(parent)->items + p + 1,
               sizeof(struct tree_map_node_item) * (D_RO(parent)->n - p));

    PM_MEMMOVE(D_RW(parent)->slots + p + 1, D_RW(parent)->slots + p + 2,
               sizeof(TOID(struct tree_map_node)) * (D_RO(parent)->n - p + 1));

    /* if the parent is empty then the tree shrinks in height */
    if (D_RO(parent)->n == 0 && TOID_EQUALS(parent, D_RO(map)->root)) {
        TX_ADD(map);
        TX_FREE(D_RO(map)->root);
        PM_EQU(D_RW(map)->root, node);
    }
}
```

This corrected code should resolve the bug and make the program work as expected.
