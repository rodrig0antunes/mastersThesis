To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue and provide a fix. Let's analyze the code and identify the bugs:

1. The first bug is located after the line `PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->n, D_RO(node)->n + D_RO(rn)->n);`. The code after this line is missing, and it seems like there is a bug in the code.

2. The second bug is located after the line `PM_EQU(D_RW(parent)->n, D_RO(parent)->n - 1);`. The code after this line is missing, and it seems like there is a bug in the code.

Now, let's provide the fixes for these bugs.
