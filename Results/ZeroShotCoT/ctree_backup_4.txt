To resolve the bug in the given program, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The function `ctree_map_insert_leaf` is defined as a static function that takes three arguments: a pointer to a `struct tree_map_entry` object `p`, a `struct tree_map_entry` object `e`, and an integer `diff`.

2. Inside the function, a new persistent object of type `struct tree_map_node` is created using the `TX_NEW` macro and assigned to the variable `new_node`.

3. The line `PM_EQU(D_RW(new_node)->diff, diff);` is incorrect. It seems like the intention is to assign the value of `diff` to the `diff` field of the `new_node` object. However, the correct way to do this is by using the `pmemobj_memcpy_persist` function. So, we need to replace this line with `pmemobj_memcpy_persist(pop, &D_RW(new_node)->diff, &diff, sizeof(diff));`.

4. The variable `d` is assigned the result of the `BIT_IS_SET` macro, which checks if the `e.key` has the bit at position `D_RO(new_node)->diff` set. This seems correct.

5. The line `D_RW(new_node)->entries[d] = e;` inserts the `e` object into the `entries` array of the `new_node` object at index `d`. This seems correct.

6. The code enters a loop that iterates until `p->slot` is not an instance of `struct tree_map_node`. Inside the loop, the `node` variable is assigned the value of `p->slot`.

7. The line `if (D_RO(node)->diff < D_RO(new_node)->diff) break;` checks if the `diff` field of the `node` object is less than the `diff` field of the `new_node` object. If true, it breaks out of the loop. This seems correct.

8. The line `p = &D_RW(node)->entries[BIT_IS_SET(e.key, D_RO(node)->diff)];` updates the `p` pointer to point to the appropriate entry in the `entries` array of the `node` object based on the critical bit. This seems correct.

9. The first `// BUG //` section is where the bug is located. To fix the bug, we need to insert the following code after the `// BUG //` comment:

```C
/* insert the found destination in the other slot */
PM_EQU(D_RW(new_node)->entries[!d], *p);

/* update the key and slot of the p object */
PM_EQU(p->key, e.key);
PM_EQU(p->slot, new_node.oid);

pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));
```

10. The second `// BUG //` section is where the bug is located. To fix the bug, we need to insert the following code after the `// BUG //` comment:

```C
/* update the key and slot of the p object */
PM_EQU(p->key, e.key);
PM_EQU(p->slot, new_node.oid);

pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));
```

11. The function ends.

Now, let's put all the corrected code together:

```C
/* ctree_map_insert_leaf -- (internal) inserts a new leaf at the position */
static void
ctree_map_insert_leaf(struct tree_map_entry *p,
                      struct tree_map_entry e, int diff)
{
    TOID(struct tree_map_node) new_node = TX_NEW(struct tree_map_node);
    pmemobj_memcpy_persist(pop, &D_RW(new_node)->diff, &diff, sizeof(diff));

    int d = BIT_IS_SET(e.key, D_RO(new_node)->diff);

    /* insert the leaf at the direction based on the critical bit */
    D_RW(new_node)->entries[d] = e;

    /* find the appropriate position in the tree to insert the node */
    TOID(struct tree_map_node) node;
    while (OID_INSTANCEOF(p->slot, struct tree_map_node)) {
        TOID_ASSIGN(node, p->slot);

        /* the critical bits have to be sorted */
        if (D_RO(node)->diff < D_RO(new_node)->diff)
            break;

        p = &D_RW(node)->entries[BIT_IS_SET(e.key, D_RO(node)->diff)];
    }

    // BUG //

    /* insert the found destination in the other slot */
    PM_EQU(D_RW(new_node)->entries[!d], *p);

    /* update the key and slot of the p object */
    PM_EQU(p->key, e.key);
    PM_EQU(p->slot, new_node.oid);

    pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));

    // BUG //
}
```

Please note that the `pop` variable used in the `pmemobj_memcpy_persist` function needs to be defined and initialized appropriately in your program.
