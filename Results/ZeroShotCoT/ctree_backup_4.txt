To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue in the code and make the necessary corrections. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the bug is related to the incorrect usage of the PM_EQU macro. The PM_EQU macro is used to assign a value to a persistent memory object, but it is not being used correctly in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the PM_EQU macro with the appropriate assignment statements.

Here is the corrected code:

``` C
/*
 * ctree_map_insert_leaf -- (internal) inserts a new leaf at the position
 */
static void
ctree_map_insert_leaf(struct tree_map_entry *p,
	struct tree_map_entry e, int diff)
{
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) new_node = TX_NEW(struct tree_map_node);
	D_RW(new_node)->diff = diff;

	int d = BIT_IS_SET(e.key, D_RO(new_node)->diff);

	/* insert the leaf at the direction based on the critical bit */
	D_RW(new_node)->entries[d] = e;

	/* find the appropriate position in the tree to insert the node */
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node;
	while (OID_INSTANCEOF(p->slot, struct tree_map_node)) {
		TOID_ASSIGN(node, p->slot);

		/* the critical bits have to be sorted */
		if (D_RO(node)->diff < D_RO(new_node)->diff)
			break;

		p = &D_RW(node)->entries[BIT_IS_SET(e.key, D_RO(node)->diff)];
	}

	// insert the found destination in the other slot
	D_RW(new_node)->entries[!d] = *p;
	
	p->key = 0;
	p->slot = new_node.oid;

	pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));
}
```

In the corrected code, we have replaced the PM_EQU macro with the appropriate assignment statements. We assign the value of `diff` to `D_RW(new_node)->diff` and assign the value of `*p` to `D_RW(new_node)->entries[!d]`. Additionally, we assign the value of 0 to `p->key` and assign `new_node.oid` to `p->slot`.

Please note that this is just one possible solution to the bug. There might be other issues in the code that need to be addressed as well.
