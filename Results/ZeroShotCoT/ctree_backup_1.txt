To resolve the bug, we need to update the code inside the `TX_BEGIN` and `TX_END` blocks. Currently, the code inside the `TX_BEGIN` and `TX_END` blocks is incorrect. 

Here's the corrected code:

``` C
if (parent == NULL) { /* root */
    TX_BEGIN(pop) {
        pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(leaf, sizeof(*leaf));
        leaf->key = 0;
    } TX_END
    leaf->slot = OID_NULL;
}
```

In the corrected code, we are using the correct syntax to assign a value to `leaf->key` and `leaf->slot`. We are also correctly adding the range of `leaf` to the transaction using `pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct`.

Now, the bug has been fixed.
