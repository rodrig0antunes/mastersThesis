The bug is located in the code block delimited by the expression '// BUG //'. Let's analyze this code block and understand what needs to be fixed.

The code block contains two lines of code that are commented out:
``` C
// pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty,
// 		sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));
```

It seems that the user intended to persist the changes made to the `count_dirty` field of the `hashmap` object. However, the code is currently commented out, which means that the changes are not being persisted.

To fix this bug, we need to uncomment the line of code that performs the persistence operation. This will ensure that the changes made to the `count_dirty` field are persisted to the persistent memory.

Let's update the code to include the fix:

``` C
/*
 * hm_atomic_insert -- inserts specified value into the hashmap,
 * returns:
 * - 0 if successful,
 * - 1 if value already existed,
 * - -1 if something bad happened
 */
int
hm_atomic_insert(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct hashmap_atomic) hashmap,
		uint64_t key, PMEMoid value)
{
	TOID(struct buckets) buckets = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets;
	TOID(struct entry) var;

	uint64_t h = hash(&hashmap, &buckets, key);
	int num = 0;

	POBJ_LIST_FOREACH(var, &D_RO(buckets)->bucket[h], list) {
		if (D_RO(var)->key == key)
			return 1;
		num++;
	}
	
	// BUG //

	PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, 1);
	pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty,
			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));
		
	// BUG //

	struct entry_args args = {
		.key = key,
		.value = value,
	};
	PMEMoid oid = POBJ_LIST_INSERT_NEW_HEAD(pop,
			&D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h],
			list, sizeof(struct entry), create_entry, &args);
	if (OID_IS_NULL(oid)) {
		fprintf(stderr, "failed to allocate entry: %s\n",
			pmemobj_errormsg());
		return -1;
	}

	PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count, (D_RW(hashmap)->count + 1));
	pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count,
			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

	PMTest_isPersistedBefore(&D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty), &D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));


	PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, 0);
	pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty,
			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));

	PMTest_isPersistedBefore(&D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count), &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));


	num++;
	if (num > MAX_HASHSET_THRESHOLD ||
			(num > MIN_HASHSET_THRESHOLD &&
			D_RO(hashmap)->count > 2 * D_RO(buckets)->nbuckets))
		hm_atomic_rebuild(pop, hashmap, D_RW(buckets)->nbuckets * 2);

	PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));
	PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

	return 0;
}
```

Now the code includes the fix for the bug. The line of code that performs the persistence operation for the `count_dirty` field has been uncommented. This will ensure that the changes made to the field are persisted to the persistent memory.
