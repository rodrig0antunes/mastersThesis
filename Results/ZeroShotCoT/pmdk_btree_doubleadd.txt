The bug is located in the code segment delimited by the expression '// BUG //'. 

To resolve the bug, we need to fix the code inside this segment. 

Let's analyze the bug and come up with a solution:

The bug is related to the removal of items from the map. The code is using the 'map_remove' function to remove items from the map, but it is not checking if the item is actually removed or not. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a check after calling the 'map_remove' function to ensure that the item is successfully removed from the map. If the item is not removed, we can print an error message and return from the function.

Here is the corrected code:

``` C
/* remove the items without outer transaction */
for (int i = 0; i < nkeys; ++i) {
    metadataPtr = metadataVectorPtr[i];
    PMTest_START;

    // BUG //
    if (strcmp("hashmap_atomic", type))
        PMTest_CHECKER_START;

    PMEMoid item;
    if (i % 2 == 0)
        item = map_remove(mapc, D_RW(root)->map, keys[i/2]);
    else
        item = map_remove(mapc, D_RW(root)->map, keys[nkeys-(i+1)/2]);

    // Check if item is removed successfully
    if (OID_IS_NULL(item)) {
        printf("Failed to remove item from map\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // BUG //

    if (strcmp("hashmap_atomic", type))
        PMTest_CHECKER_END;
    PMTest_END;
    C_execVeri(p, metadataPtr);

    assert(OID_INSTANCEOF(item, struct store_item));
}
```

Now the bug is fixed and the program should work as expected.
