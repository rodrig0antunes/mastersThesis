To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the modifications made to the persistent memory are correctly persisted. The bug is located in two places, as indicated by the "// BUG //" comments.

To fix the bug, we need to add the appropriate persist operations before and after modifying the persistent memory.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```C
/*
* hm_atomic_remove -- removes specified value from the hashmap,
* returns:
* - 1 if successful,
* - 0 if value didn't exist,
* - -1 if something bad happened
*/
PMEMoid
hm_atomic_remove(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct hashmap_atomic) hashmap,
                 uint64_t key)
{
    TOID(struct buckets) buckets = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets;
    TOID(struct entry) var;

    uint64_t h = hash(&hashmap, &buckets, key);
    POBJ_LIST_FOREACH(var, &D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h], list) {
        if (D_RO(var)->key == key)
            break;
    }

    if (TOID_IS_NULL(var))
        return OID_NULL;

    // BUG //

    PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, 1);

    if (POBJ_LIST_REMOVE_FREE(pop, &D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h],
                               var, list)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "list remove failed: %s\n",
                pmemobj_errormsg());
        return OID_NULL;
    }

    PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count, D_RO(hashmap)->count - 1);
    pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty,
                    sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));
    pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count,
                    sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

    // BUG //

    PMTest_isPersistedBefore(&D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty), &D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

    PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, 0);
    pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty,
                    sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));

    if (D_RO(hashmap)->count < D_RO(buckets)->nbuckets)
        hm_atomic_rebuild(pop, hashmap, D_RO(buckets)->nbuckets / 2);

    PMTest_isPersistedBefore(&D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count), &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));

    PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));
    PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

    return D_RO(var)->value;
}
```

In the corrected version, we have added the `pmemobj_persist` function calls before and after the modifications to the persistent memory. These calls ensure that the modifications are correctly persisted.

Please note that the code within the "// BUG //" comments has been replaced with the corrected code.
