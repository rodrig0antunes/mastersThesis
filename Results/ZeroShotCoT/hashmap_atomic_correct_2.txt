To resolve the bug, we need to fix the code within the "// BUG //" section. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the bug is related to the use of the macro `PM_EQU`. This macro is not a standard PMDK macro and is likely causing the bug. 

To fix this, we can replace the `PM_EQU` macro with a direct assignment statement. 

Here's the corrected code:

``` C
/*
 * hm_atomic_remove -- removes specified value from the hashmap,
 * returns:
 * - 1 if successful,
 * - 0 if value didn't exist,
 * - -1 if something bad happened
 */
PMEMoid
hm_atomic_remove(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct hashmap_atomic) hashmap,
		uint64_t key)
{
	TOID(struct buckets) buckets = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets;
	TOID(struct entry) var;

	uint64_t h = hash(&hashmap, &buckets, key);
	POBJ_LIST_FOREACH(var, &D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h], list) {
		if (D_RO(var)->key == key)
			break;
	}

	if (TOID_IS_NULL(var))
		return OID_NULL;
		
		// BUG //

	D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty = 1;
	
	if (POBJ_LIST_REMOVE_FREE(pop, &D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h],
			var, list)) {
		fprintf(stderr, "list remove failed: %s\n",
			pmemobj_errormsg());
		return OID_NULL;
	}


	D_RW(hashmap)->count = D_RO(hashmap)->count - 1;
	pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty,
			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));
	pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count,
			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));
		
		// BUG //

	PMTest_isPersistedBefore(&D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty), &D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

	D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty = 0;
	pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty,
			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));

	if (D_RO(hashmap)->count < D_RO(buckets)->nbuckets)
		hm_atomic_rebuild(pop, hashmap, D_RO(buckets)->nbuckets / 2);

	PMTest_isPersistedBefore(&D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count), &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));

	PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));
	PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));

	return D_RO(var)->value;
}
```

Now the code should be free of bugs and should work as expected.
