To resolve the bug, we need to replace the expression `PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);` with the correct code. 

The correct code should be:
```C
D_RW(node)->slots[!c] = D_RO(child)->slots[c];
```

This will correctly assign the value of `D_RO(child)->slots[c]` to `D_RW(node)->slots[!c]`.

Now let's replace the code in the original program and check if there are any other bugs.
