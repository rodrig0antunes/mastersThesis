To resolve the bug, we need to fix the code within the delimited area. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the bug is related to freeing the memory allocated for the `buckets` object. The code `POBJ_FREE(&D_RO(hashmap)->buckets);` is used to free the memory, but it is incorrect because `buckets` is a persistent object and should not be freed using `POBJ_FREE`.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the line `POBJ_FREE(&D_RO(hashmap)->buckets);` and replace it with the correct code to free the memory.

Additionally, the line `PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets, D_RO(hashmap)->buckets_tmp);` is also incorrect. It seems that the intention is to copy the contents of `buckets_tmp` to `buckets`. To fix this, we need to replace the line with the correct code to copy the contents.

Let's make these corrections in the code.
