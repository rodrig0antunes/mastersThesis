To resolve the bug, we need to make the following changes:

1. Remove the line `POBJ_FREE(&D_RO(hashmap)->buckets);` as it is not necessary and may cause issues.

2. Uncomment the line `pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets));` to persist the changes made to the `buckets` field.

3. Uncomment the line `pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp));` to persist the changes made to the `buckets_tmp` field.

Here is the corrected program:

``` C
/*
* hm_atomic_rebuild_finish -- finishes rebuild, assumes buckets_tmp is not null
*/
static void
hm_atomic_rebuild_finish(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct hashmap_atomic) hashmap)
{
    TOID(struct buckets) cur = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets;
    TOID(struct buckets) tmp = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets_tmp;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < D_RO(cur)->nbuckets; ++i) {
        while (!POBJ_LIST_EMPTY(&D_RO(cur)->bucket[i])) {
            TOID(struct entry) en =
                POBJ_LIST_FIRST(&D_RO(cur)->bucket[i]);
            uint64_t h = hash(&hashmap, &tmp, D_RO(en)->key);

            if (POBJ_LIST_MOVE_ELEMENT_HEAD(pop,
                &D_RW(cur)->bucket[i],
                &D_RW(tmp)->bucket[h],
                en, list, list)) {
                fprintf(stderr, "move failed: %s\n",
                    pmemobj_errormsg());
                abort();
            }
        }
    }

    // BUG //

    // POBJ_FREE(&D_RO(hashmap)->buckets);

    pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets,
        sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets));

    // BUG //

    /* We have to set offset manually instead of substituting OID_NULL,
    * because we won't be able to recover easily if crash happens after
    * pool_uuid_lo, but before offset is set. Another reason why everyone
    * should use transaction API.
    * See recovery process in hm_init and TOID_IS_NULL macro definition.
    */
    PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp.oid.off, 0);
    pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp,
        sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp));

    PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->buckets, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets));
    PMTest_isPersistent(&D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp));
}
```

Please note that the code within the `// BUG //` markers has been commented out or removed, and the necessary lines have been uncommented.
