To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue in the code. The bug is located within the area delimited by the expression '// BUG //'. Let's analyze the code within this area:

``` C
// BUG //

TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;

// TX_ADD(node);	
TX_ADD(child);

PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);

// BUG //
```

The bug seems to be related to the transactional memory operations. The `TX_ADD(child)` operation is correctly placed, but the `TX_ADD(node)` operation is commented out. We need to uncomment this line to ensure that the `node` object is included in the transaction.

To fix the bug, we need to uncomment the line `TX_ADD(node);` within the code:

``` C
// BUG //

TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;

TX_ADD(node);	
TX_ADD(child);

PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);

// BUG //
```

Now the bug is fixed. The `node` object will be included in the transaction, ensuring that the changes made to it are persistent.
