To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue in the code. The bug is located within the code block delimited by the expression '// BUG //'. Let's analyze this code block and identify the problem.

``` C
// BUG //

TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;

TX_ADD(child);

PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);

// BUG //
```

The bug seems to be related to the assignment of `child` variable. The code is trying to assign `D_RO(node)->slots[!c]` to `child`, but it is missing the transactional context. To fix this bug, we need to add the transactional context to the assignment statement.

``` C
// BUG //

TOID(struct tree_map_node) child;
TX_ADD(node);
child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;

TX_ADD(child);

PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);

// BUG //
```

Now, the assignment of `child` variable is within the transactional context, and the bug should be resolved.
