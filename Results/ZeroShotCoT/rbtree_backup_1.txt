To resolve the bug, we need to identify the issue in the code. The bug is located between the two "// BUG //" comments. Let's analyze the code in that section.

The first line inside the bug section is:
```C
TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
```
This line is correctly assigning the `child` variable to the opposite child of the `node` based on the `c` parameter.

The second line inside the bug section is:
```C
PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);
```
This line is using the `PM_EQU` macro to assign the opposite child of `node` to the child of `child` based on the `c` parameter. This line seems to be correct.

The third line inside the bug section is:
```C
if (!TOID_EQUALS(D_RO(child)->slots[c], s))
    TX_SET(D_RW(child)->slots[c], parent, node);
```
This line is checking if the child of `child` is not equal to the sentinel `s`. If it's not equal, it sets the parent of the child of `child` to `node`. This line seems to be correct.

The issue seems to be with the missing closing brace for the `rbtree_map_rotate` function. Let's add the closing brace at the end of the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```C
/*
 * rbtree_map_rotate -- (internal) performs a left/right rotation around a node
 */
static void
rbtree_map_rotate(TOID(struct rbtree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node, enum rb_children c)
{
	
		// BUG //
		
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;

	
	TX_ADD(child);

	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);
		
		// BUG //

	if (!TOID_EQUALS(D_RO(child)->slots[c], s))
		TX_SET(D_RW(child)->slots[c], parent, node);
	
	PM_EQU(NODE_P(child), NODE_P(node));

	TX_SET(NODE_P(node), slots[NODE_LOCATION(node)], child);

	PM_EQU(D_RW(child)->slots[c], node);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->parent, child);
}
```
