### Explanation
In the correction, the code is wrapped inside a transaction block using `TX_BEGIN` and `TX_END`. 
Inside the transaction block, two new lines are added:
1. `TX_ADD_DIRECT(dst);` - This line registers `dst` as a part of the transaction, ensuring that any changes made to `dst` are properly recorded. 
2. `TX_ADD_DIRECT(n);` - This line registers `n` as a part of the transaction, ensuring that any changes made to `n` are properly recorded.

By adding these lines, the transaction system ensures that the assignments of `parent` and `n` to their respective variables are properly recorded. 
If the transaction is successful, these changes will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, they will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of your persistent memory data structures.
