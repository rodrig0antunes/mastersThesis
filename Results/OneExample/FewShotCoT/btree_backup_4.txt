### CORRECTED PERSISTENT MEMORY PROGRAM

``` C
/*
 * btree_map_rotate_right -- (internal) takes one element from right sibling
 */
static void
btree_map_rotate_right(TOID(struct tree_map_node) rsb,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) parent, int p)
{
	/* move the separator from parent to the deficient node */
	struct tree_map_node_item sep = D_RO(parent)->items[p];
	btree_map_insert_item(node, D_RO(node)->n, sep);

	/* the first element of the right sibling is the new separator */
	TX_ADD_FIELD(parent, items[p]);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(parent)->items[p], D_RO(rsb)->items[0]);

	/* the nodes are not necessarily leafs, so copy also the slot */
	TX_ADD_FIELD(node, slots[D_RO(node)->n]);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[D_RO(node)->n], D_RO(rsb)->slots[0]);

	TX_ADD_FIELD(rsb, n);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(rsb)->n, D_RO(rsb)->n - 1); /* it loses one element, but still > min */

	/* move all existing elements back by one array slot */
	PM_MEMMOVE(D_RW(rsb)->items, D_RO(rsb)->items + 1,
		sizeof(struct tree_map_node_item) * (D_RO(rsb)->n));
	PM_MEMMOVE(D_RW(rsb)->slots, D_RO(rsb)->slots + 1,
		sizeof(TOID(struct tree_map_node)) * (D_RO(rsb)->n + 1));
}
```

### Explanation
In the incorrect program, there are two bugs to fix, both delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions.

In the corrected program, the first bug fix is to add the line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(node, slots[D_RO(node)->n]);' before assigning the value of 'D_RO(rsb)->slots[0]' to 'D_RW(node)->slots[D_RO(node)->n]'. This line registers the field 'slots[D_RO(node)->n]' of the 'node' object as a part of the transaction, ensuring that any changes made to this field are properly recorded and can be rolled back if the transaction aborts.

The second bug fix is to add the line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(rsb, n);' before decrementing the value of 'D_RW(rsb)->n'. This line registers the field 'n' of the 'rsb' object as a part of the transaction, ensuring that any changes made to this field are properly recorded and can be rolled back if the transaction aborts.

By adding these two 'TX_ADD_FIELD' lines, the changes made to the 'node' object and the 'rsb' object are properly recorded and can be committed or rolled back as a part of the transaction, ensuring the consistency of the persistent memory data structures.
