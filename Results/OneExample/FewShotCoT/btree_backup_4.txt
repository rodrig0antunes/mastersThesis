### CORRECTED PERSISTENT MEMORY PROGRAM

``` C
/*
 * btree_map_rotate_right -- (internal) takes one element from right sibling
 */
static void
btree_map_rotate_right(TOID(struct tree_map_node) rsb,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) parent, int p)
{
	/* move the separator from parent to the deficient node */
	struct tree_map_node_item sep = D_RO(parent)->items[p];
	btree_map_insert_item(node, D_RO(node)->n, sep);

	/* the first element of the right sibling is the new separator */
	TX_ADD_FIELD(parent, items[p]);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(parent)->items[p], D_RO(rsb)->items[0]);

	/* the nodes are not necessarily leafs, so copy also the slot */
	TX_ADD_FIELD(node, slots[D_RO(node)->n]);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[D_RO(node)->n], D_RO(rsb)->slots[0]);

	TX_ADD_FIELD(rsb, n);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(rsb)->n, D_RO(rsb)->n - 1); /* it loses one element, but still > min */

	/* move all existing elements back by one array slot */
	PM_MEMMOVE(D_RW(rsb)->items, D_RO(rsb)->items + 1,
		sizeof(struct tree_map_node_item) * (D_RO(rsb)->n));
	PM_MEMMOVE(D_RW(rsb)->slots, D_RO(rsb)->slots + 1,

### Explanation
In the incorrect program, there are two bugs to fix, both located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.

In the corrected program, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.

For the first bug fix, the line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(node, slots[D_RO(node)->n]);' is added before copying the slot from the right sibling to the deficient node. This line tells the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'slots' array of the 'node' during the transaction. By adding 'TX_ADD_FIELD(node, slots[D_RO(node)->n]);', the transaction system ensures that the assignment of the slot from the right sibling to the deficient node is properly recorded.

For the second bug fix, the line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(rsb, n);' is added before decrementing the 'n' field of the right sibling node. This line tells the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'n' field of the right sibling node during the transaction. By adding 'TX_ADD_FIELD(rsb, n);', the transaction system ensures that the decrement of the 'n' field is properly recorded.

These bug fixes ensure that the modifications made to the persistent memory data structures are properly recorded by the transaction system, maintaining the consistency of the data in case of a transaction abort.
