### Explanation
In the correction, two lines are added to properly register the modifications made to the 'node' and 'rsb' objects within the transaction.
The line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(node, slots[D_RO(node)->n]);' is added to register the modification of the 'slots' array in the 'node' object. This ensures that if the transaction aborts, the changes made to the 'slots' array are rolled back.
The line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(rsb, n);' is added to register the modification of the 'n' field in the 'rsb' object. This ensures that if the transaction aborts, the change made to the 'n' field is rolled back.
By adding these two lines, the modifications made to the 'node' and 'rsb' objects are properly recorded within the transaction, ensuring the consistency of the persistent memory data structures.
