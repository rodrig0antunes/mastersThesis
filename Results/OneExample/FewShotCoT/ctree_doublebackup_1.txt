### Explanation
In the correction, the missing code has been added between the '// BUG //' markers. The missing code is responsible for adding the modified objects to the transaction using 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct' function. 
The corrected code adds the modified objects 'D_RW(new_node)->entries[!d]' and 'p' to the transaction using 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct' function. This ensures that the modifications made to these objects are persistent and will be committed to the persistent memory.
