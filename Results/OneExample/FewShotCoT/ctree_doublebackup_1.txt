### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the first bug fix is to add the missing 'sizeof' operator in the 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct' call. The correct call should be 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(&D_RW(new_node)->entries[!d], sizeof(D_RW(new_node)->entries[!d]));'. This ensures that the correct range is added to the transaction.
The second bug fix is to add the missing 'sizeof' operator in the 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct' call. The correct call should be 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));'. This ensures that the correct range is added to the transaction.
