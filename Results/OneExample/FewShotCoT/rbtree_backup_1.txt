### CORRECTED PERSISTENT MEMORY PROGRAM

``` C
/*
 * rbtree_map_rotate -- (internal) performs a left/right rotation around a node
 */
static void
rbtree_map_rotate(TOID(struct rbtree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node, enum rb_children c)
{
	
		// BUG //
		
	TX_ADD_DIRECT(node);
	TX_ADD_DIRECT(map);
	
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;

	
	TX_ADD(child);

	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);
		
		// BUG //

	if (!TOID_EQUALS(D_RO(child)->slots[c], s))
		TX_SET(D_RW(child)->slots[c], parent, node);
	
	PM_EQU(NODE_P(child), NODE_P(node));

	TX_SET(NODE_P(node), slots[NODE_LOCATION(node)], child);

	PM_EQU(D_RW(child)->slots[c], node);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->parent, child);
}
```

### Explanation
In the incorrect program, the bug is located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the corrected program, the bug fix is put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, two new lines 'TX_ADD_DIRECT(node);' and 'TX_ADD_DIRECT(map);' are added before the code that modifies the 'node' and 'map' variables. 
These lines tell the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'node' and 'map' variables during the transaction. It essentially registers 'node' and 'map' as a part of the transaction, making sure that if the transaction aborts, the changes to 'node' and 'map' are rolled back as well.
By adding 'TX_ADD_DIRECT(node);' and 'TX_ADD_DIRECT(map);', the transaction system ensures that the modifications to 'node' and 'map' are properly recorded. 
If the transaction is successful, these changes will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, they will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of your persistent memory data structures.
