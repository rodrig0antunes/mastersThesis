### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, both located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the 'TX_ADD(node);' call is added after the first 'PM_MEMMOVE' call. This is necessary to ensure that the modifications made by the 'PM_MEMMOVE' call are included in the transaction.
Similarly, the 'TX_ADD(node);' call is added after the 'btree_map_insert_item_at' call to include the modifications made by that function in the transaction.
By adding the 'TX_ADD(node);' calls in the appropriate places, the modifications made to the 'node' object are correctly included in the transaction.
