### Explanation
In the correction, the code block between the `// BUG //` markers is modified. The following changes are made:

1. The line `struct tree_map_entry *dest = parent;` is removed because it is not necessary.

2. The line `// pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(dest, sizeof(*dest));` is commented out because it is not needed.

3. The line `PM_EQU(*dest, D_RW(node)->entries[D_RO(node)->entries[0].key == leaf->key]);` is replaced with `pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(parent, sizeof(*parent));` to add the `parent` object to the transaction.

4. The line `TX_FREE(node);` is kept as it is because it correctly frees the `node` object.

By adding `pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(parent, sizeof(*parent));`, the transaction system ensures that the modifications made to the `parent` object are properly recorded. If the transaction is successful, these changes will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, they will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of the persistent memory data structures.
