### CORRECTED PERSISTENT MEMORY PROGRAM
``` C
/*
 * rbtree_map_rotate -- (internal) performs a left/right rotation around a node
 */
static void
rbtree_map_rotate(TOID(struct rbtree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node, enum rb_children c)
{
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;
		
	// BUG //
	TX_BEGIN(map.oid) {
		TX_ADD(node);
		TX_ADD(child);
		
		PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);
		
		// BUG //
		if (!TOID_EQUALS(D_RO(child)->slots[c], s))
			TX_SET(D_RW(child)->slots[c], parent, node);
		
		PM_EQU(NODE_P(child), NODE_P(node));

		TX_SET(NODE_P(node), slots[NODE_LOCATION(node)], child);

		PM_EQU(D_RW(child)->slots[c], node);
		PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->parent, child);
	} TX_ONABORT {
		// handle transaction abort
	} TX_END
}
```

### Explanation
In the corrected program, the transaction is properly defined using `TX_BEGIN` and `TX_END` macros. The `TX_ADD` macro is used to register the `node` and `child` objects as part of the transaction. This ensures that any modifications made to these objects are properly recorded and can be rolled back if the transaction aborts.

The first `// BUG //` section is fixed by adding the `TX_BEGIN` macro before the transactional code block. This ensures that the modifications made to `node` and `child` are part of the transaction.

The second `// BUG //` section is fixed by adding the `TX_SET` macro to update the `parent` field of `child` with the value of `node`. This change is also made within the transactional code block.

By properly defining the transaction and registering the objects to be modified, the corrected program ensures that the modifications made to the persistent memory objects are consistent and durable.
