### CORRECTED PERSISTENT MEMORY PROGRAM

``` C
/*
 * rbtree_map_rotate -- (internal) performs a left/right rotation around a node
 */
static void
rbtree_map_rotate(TOID(struct rbtree_map) map,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node, enum rb_children c)
{
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) child = D_RO(node)->slots[!c];
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) s = D_RO(map)->sentinel;
		
		// BUG //

	TX_ADD(node);
	TX_ADD(child);

	
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);
		
		// BUG //

	if (!TOID_EQUALS(D_RO(child)->slots[c], s))
		TX_SET(D_RW(child)->slots[c], parent, node);
	
	PM_EQU(NODE_P(child), NODE_P(node));

	TX_SET(NODE_P(node), slots[NODE_LOCATION(node)], child);

	PM_EQU(D_RW(child)->slots[c], node);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->parent, child);
}
```

### Explanation
In the incorrect program, there are two bugs to fix, both delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions.
In the corrected program, the bug fixes are put in the areas of the code delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, two lines 'TX_ADD(node);' and 'TX_ADD(child);' are added before the memory operations.
These lines tell the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'node' and 'child' pointers during the transaction. It essentially registers 'node' and 'child' as a part of the transaction, making sure that if the transaction aborts, the changes to 'node' and 'child' are rolled back as well.
By adding 'TX_ADD(node);' and 'TX_ADD(child);', the transaction system ensures that the memory operations are properly recorded. 
If the transaction is successful, these changes will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, they will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of your persistent memory data structures.
