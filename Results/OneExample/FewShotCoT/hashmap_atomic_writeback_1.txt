### Explanation
In the given code, there are two bugs that need to be fixed. The first bug is that the `POBJ_FREE` function is used to free the memory of `D_RW(hashmap)->buckets`, but it should not be freed because it is a persistent object. The second bug is that the `PM_EQU` macro is used to assign `D_RO(hashmap)->buckets_tmp` to `D_RW(hashmap)->buckets`, but it should be assigned using the `TOID_ASSIGN` macro. 

The corrected code fixes these bugs by removing the `POBJ_FREE` function call and replacing the `PM_EQU` macro with the `TOID_ASSIGN` macro. Additionally, the `pmemobj_persist` function is called to ensure that the changes to `D_RW(hashmap)->buckets` and `D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp` are durably stored in the persistent memory pool.
