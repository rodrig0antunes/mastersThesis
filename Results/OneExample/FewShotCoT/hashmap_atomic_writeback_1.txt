### Explanation
In the original code, there are two "BUG" markers indicating the location of the errors. 

1. The first error is that the line `POBJ_FREE(&D_RO(hashmap)->buckets);` is missing the `pmemobj_persist()` call to ensure that the change is durably stored in the persistent memory pool. To fix this, we need to add the `pmemobj_persist()` call after the `POBJ_FREE()` call, like this: `pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets));`.

2. The second error is that the line `// pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets));` is commented out. This line should not be commented out because it is necessary to persist the change made to `D_RW(hashmap)->buckets`. To fix this, we need to remove the comment markers (`//`) to uncomment the line.

By making these corrections, the program will properly persist the changes made to the `buckets` and `buckets_tmp` variables in the persistent memory pool.
