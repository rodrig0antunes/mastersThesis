### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to fix, both located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, after the line 'POBJ_FREE(&D_RW(hashmap)->buckets);', it is necessary to add 'pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets));' to ensure that the changes made to the 'buckets' object are durably stored in the persistent memory pool.
After the line 'PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets, D_RO(hashmap)->buckets_tmp);', it is necessary to add 'pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp));' to ensure that the changes made to the 'buckets_tmp' object are durably stored in the persistent memory pool.
By adding these two 'pmemobj_persist' calls, it is guaranteed that the changes made to both 'buckets' and 'buckets_tmp' objects are properly preserved, and the data remains consistent. This correction ensures data durability in persistent memory.
