### CORRECTED PERSISTENT MEMORY PROGRAM

``` C
/*
 * ctree_map_insert_leaf -- (internal) inserts a new leaf at the position
 */
static void
ctree_map_insert_leaf(struct tree_map_entry *p,
	struct tree_map_entry e, int diff)
{
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) new_node = TX_NEW(struct tree_map_node);
	//isPersistent(&(D_RW(new_node)->diff), sizeof(D_RW(new_node)->diff));
	PM_EQU(D_RW(new_node)->diff, diff);

	int d = BIT_IS_SET(e.key, D_RO(new_node)->diff);

	/* insert the leaf at the direction based on the critical bit */
	D_RW(new_node)->entries[d] = e;

	/* find the appropriate position in the tree to insert the node */
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) node;
	while (OID_INSTANCEOF(p->slot, struct tree_map_node)) {
		TOID_ASSIGN(node, p->slot);

		/* the critical bits have to be sorted */
		if (D_RO(node)->diff < D_RO(new_node)->diff)
			break;

		p = &D_RW(node)->entries[BIT_IS_SET(e.key, D_RO(node)->diff)];
	}

	// BUG //
	
	/* insert the found destination in the other slot */
	PM_EQU(D_RW(new_node)->entries[!d], *p);
	
	/* update the key and slot of the parent entry */
	PM_EQU(p->key, e.key);
	PM_EQU(p->slot, new_node.oid);

	pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));
	
	// BUG //
}
```

### Explanation
In the incorrect program, there are two bugs to fix, both located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.

In the correction, the first bug fix is to update the key and slot of the parent entry before assigning the new node to the parent entry's slot. This ensures that the parent entry is correctly updated with the new node's information.

The second bug fix is to add the parent entry 'p' to the transaction using 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct'. This ensures that the changes made to the parent entry are properly recorded in the transaction and will be committed if the transaction is successful or rolled back if the transaction aborts.

By making these bug fixes, the program will correctly insert a new leaf at the desired position in the tree and maintain the consistency of the persistent memory data structure.
