### Explanation
In the given code, there are two bugs to fix, both located in the area of the code delimited by the two `// BUG //` expressions.

In the first bug fix, the line `PM_EQU(D_RW(map)->root, up);` is added to assign the value of `up` to `map->root`. This ensures that the root of the tree is properly updated when replacing the root node.

In the second bug fix, the line `TX_ADD_FIELD(map, root);` is added to register the `root` field of `map` as part of the transaction. This ensures that the update to `map->root` is properly included in the transaction, maintaining data consistency.
