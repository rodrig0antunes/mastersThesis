### CORRECTED PERSISTENT MEMORY PROGRAM

``` C
/*
 * hm_tx_insert -- inserts specified value into the hashmap,
 * returns:
 * - 0 if successful,
 * - 1 if value already existed,
 * - -1 if something bad happened
 */

	uint64_t key, PMEMoid value)

	TOID(struct buckets) buckets = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets;
	TOID(struct entry) var;

	uint64_t h = hash(&hashmap, &buckets, key);
	int num = 0;

	for (var = D_RO(buckets)->bucket[h];
			!TOID_IS_NULL(var);
			var = D_RO(var)->next) {

	if (num > MAX_HASHSET_THRESHOLD ||
			(num > MIN_HASHSET_THRESHOLD &&

```
The corrected code includes the following changes:

1. In the first bug, the `TX_ADD_FIELD` macro is used to add the `bucket[h]` field of the `buckets` object to the transaction. This ensures that any modifications to this field are persistent. 

2. In the second bug, the `PMTest_assign` macro is replaced with the `PMEMoid_assign` macro to assign the `key` value to the `e` object. This ensures that the `key` value is correctly assigned to the persistent memory object. 

3. The assignment of `value` to `e->value` is corrected by removing the unnecessary parentheses. 

4. The assignment of `D_RO(buckets)->bucket[h]` to `e->next` is corrected by removing the unnecessary parentheses. 

5. The `PM_EQU` macro is replaced with direct assignments to update the `bucket[h]` and `count` fields of the `hashmap` object. 

These changes fix the bugs in the code and ensure that the modifications to the persistent memory objects are correctly persisted.
