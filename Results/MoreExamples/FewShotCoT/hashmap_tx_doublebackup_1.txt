### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the areas of the code delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions.

1. In the first bug fix, the 'TX_ADD_FIELD(D_RO(hashmap)->buckets, bucket[h]);' statement has been replaced with 'TX_ADD_FIELD(D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h], next);'. The correct way to add the 'next' field of the 'bucket[h]' entry to the transaction is by using 'D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h]' instead of 'D_RO(hashmap)->buckets'.

2. In the second bug fix, the 'TX_ADD_FIELD(hashmap, count);' statement has been removed. The 'count' field of the 'hashmap' does not need to be added to the transaction because it is already added in the previous line.

These bug fixes ensure that the correct fields are added to the transaction and preserve the intended behavior of the code.
