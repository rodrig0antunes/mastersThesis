### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, both located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the first bug fix is to change the 'TX_ADD_FIELD(D_RO(hashmap)->buckets, bucket[h]);' statement to 'TX_ADD_FIELD(D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h], next);'. 
This change correctly adds the 'next' field of the 'bucket[h]' entry to the transaction, ensuring that modifications to this field are persistent.
The second bug fix is to remove the duplicate 'TX_ADD_FIELD(hashmap, count);' statement. The 'count' field of the 'hashmap' structure is already added to the transaction before the 'TX_NEW' call, so the duplicate statement is unnecessary and can be removed.
These bug fixes ensure that the modifications made to the 'buckets' and 'count' fields are correctly added to the transaction and persisted in the persistent memory.
