### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, each located in the area of the code delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions.

In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the respective areas of the code delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions.

For the first bug fix, the line 'pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));' is added right after the update of 'D_RW(hashmap)->count' to ensure that the change to 'D_RW(hashmap)->count' is durably stored in persistent memory.

For the second bug fix, the line 'pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty));' is added right after the update of 'D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty' to ensure that the change to 'D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty' is durably stored in persistent memory.

By making these changes, the persistent actions occur right after the respective value updates, ensuring that both 'D_RW(hashmap)->count' and 'D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty' are updated and durably stored in a consistent and reliable order, preserving data integrity in persistent memory.
