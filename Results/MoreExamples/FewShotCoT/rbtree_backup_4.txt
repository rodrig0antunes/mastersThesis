## Explanation
In the example, the bug to repair is located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fix is put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, a new line 'TX_ADD_DIRECT(n);' is added before setting the value of 'n->parent'. 
This line tells the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'n' pointer during the transaction. It essentially registers 'n' as a part of the transaction, making sure that if the transaction aborts, the changes to 'n' are rolled back as well.
By adding 'TX_ADD_DIRECT(n);', the transaction system ensures that the assignment of 'n->parent' is properly recorded. 
If the transaction is successful, this change will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, it will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of your persistent memory data structures.
