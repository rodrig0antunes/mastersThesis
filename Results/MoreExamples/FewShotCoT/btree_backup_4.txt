## Explanation
In the correction, two lines are added to fix the bugs in the code. The first bug is fixed by adding 'TX_ADD_FIELD(rsb, n);' before modifying the value of 'D_RW(rsb)->n'. This line tells the transaction system that the 'n' field of the 'rsb' node is being modified during the transaction. This ensures that the change to 'D_RW(rsb)->n' is properly recorded and will be committed if the transaction is successful or rolled back if the transaction aborts.

The second bug is fixed by adding 'TX_ADD_FIELD(rsb, items[0]);' before modifying the value of 'D_RW(rsb)->items[0]'. This line tells the transaction system that the 'items[0]' field of the 'rsb' node is being modified during the transaction. This ensures that the change to 'D_RW(rsb)->items[0]' is properly recorded and will be committed if the transaction is successful or rolled back if the transaction aborts.
