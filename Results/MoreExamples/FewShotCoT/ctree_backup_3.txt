## Explanation
In the correction, the code block between the two '// BUG //' comments is moved inside the transaction block. 
The transaction block is started with 'TX_BEGIN(pop)' and ended with 'TX_END'. 
By moving the code block inside the transaction, the operations performed on the persistent memory are now part of the transaction. 
This ensures that the changes made to the persistent memory are either committed or rolled back as a whole, maintaining the consistency of the data.
