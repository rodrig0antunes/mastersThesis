### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the areas of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the areas of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the first bug fix is to move the closing brace of the 'if' statement to the correct position. The closing brace should be placed after the 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(p, sizeof(*p));' line. This ensures that the transaction system properly records the modification of the 'p' pointer and its size.
The second bug fix is to move the closing brace of the 'else' statement to the correct position. The closing brace should be placed before the '// BUG //' expression. This ensures that the transaction system properly records the modification of the 'map' pointer and its size.
By making these changes, the transaction system will correctly record the modifications made to the persistent memory data structures, ensuring data consistency and durability.
