### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the areas of the code delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions.

In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the areas of the code delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions.

For the first bug, the redundant 'pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));' call has been removed. It is unnecessary to persist the same data twice, so the redundant call is eliminated.

For the second bug, the 'PMTest_isPersistedBefore(&D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty), &D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));' call has been moved to the correct position after the 'pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->count, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->count));' call. This ensures that the data is persisted before the check is made.

The correction ensures that the necessary data is correctly persisted in the persistent memory pool and that the program behaves as expected.
