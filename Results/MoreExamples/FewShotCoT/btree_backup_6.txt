## Explanation
In the correction, two lines are added to fix the bug. 
The first line 'TX_ADD(node);' is added before modifying the 'node' object. This line tells the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'node' object during the transaction. It essentially registers 'node' as a part of the transaction, making sure that if the transaction aborts, the changes to 'node' are rolled back as well.
By adding 'TX_ADD(node);', the transaction system ensures that the modifications to 'node' are properly recorded. 
If the transaction is successful, these changes will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, they will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of your persistent memory data structures.

The second line 'PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->items[p], EMPTY_ITEM);' is added to set the 'items[p]' to 'EMPTY_ITEM' when the condition 'D_RO(node)->n == 1 || p == BTREE_ORDER - 2' is true. This ensures that the element at position 'p' in the 'node' is properly removed and marked as empty.
