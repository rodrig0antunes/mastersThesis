## Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the first bug fix is to change the line 'PM_MEMMOVE(&D_RW(node)->items[p], &D_RW(node)->items[p + 1], sizeof(struct tree_map_node_item) * (D_RO(node)->n - p));' to 'PM_MEMMOVE(&D_RW(node)->items[p], &D_RW(node)->items[p + 1], sizeof(struct tree_map_node_item) * (D_RO(node)->n - p - 1));'. 
This change fixes the bug where the number of elements being moved is incorrect. The correct number of elements to move is 'D_RO(node)->n - p - 1' because we want to move all the elements after the element being removed.
The second bug fix is to add the line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(node, items[p]);' before assigning the value of 'D_RO(lm)->items[0]' to 'D_RW(node)->items[p]'. This line tells the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'items[p]' field of the 'node' during the transaction. It essentially registers 'items[p]' as a part of the transaction, making sure that if the transaction aborts, the changes to 'items[p]' are rolled back as well.
By adding 'TX_ADD_FIELD(node, items[p]);', the transaction system ensures that the assignment of the value from 'D_RO(lm)->items[0]' to 'D_RW(node)->items[p]' is properly recorded. 
If the transaction is successful, this change will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, it will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of your persistent memory data structures.
