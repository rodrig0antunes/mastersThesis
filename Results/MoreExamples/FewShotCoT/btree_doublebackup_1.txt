### Corrected Persistent Memory Program

``` C
/*
 * btree_map_insert_node -- (internal) inserts and makes space for new node
 */
static void
btree_map_insert_node(TOID(struct tree_map_node) node, int p,
	struct tree_map_node_item item,
	TOID(struct tree_map_node) left, TOID(struct tree_map_node) right)
{
	TX_ADD(node);
	if (D_RO(node)->items[p].key != 0) { /* move all existing data */
		PM_MEMMOVE(&D_RW(node)->items[p + 1], &D_RW(node)->items[p],
		sizeof(struct tree_map_node_item) * ((BTREE_ORDER - 2 - p)));
		PM_MEMMOVE(&D_RW(node)->slots[p + 1], &D_RW(node)->slots[p],
		sizeof(TOID(struct tree_map_node)) * ((BTREE_ORDER - 1 - p)));
	}
	TX_ADD(node);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[p], left);
	PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[p + 1], right);
	btree_map_insert_item_at(node, p, item);
	TX_ADD(node); // Add the node to the transaction again after the item insertion
}
```

### Explanation
In the given code, there are two bugs to fix. The first bug is that the `TX_ADD(node)` statement is missing after moving the existing data. The second bug is that the `TX_ADD(node)` statement is missing after inserting the new item.

In the corrected code, the missing `TX_ADD(node)` statement is added after moving the existing data and after inserting the new item. This ensures that the changes made to the `node` object are properly added to the transaction.

By adding the missing `TX_ADD(node)` statements, the corrected code ensures that all modifications to the `node` object are included in the transaction, preserving the correct transactional behavior.
