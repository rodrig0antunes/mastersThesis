## Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, two lines 'TX_ADD(node);' and 'TX_ADD(child);' are added before the assignment 'PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[!c], D_RO(child)->slots[c]);' to ensure that both 'node' and 'child' are properly registered as part of the transaction. 
By adding 'TX_ADD(node);' and 'TX_ADD(child);', the transaction system ensures that the changes made to 'node' and 'child' are properly recorded. If the transaction aborts, these changes will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of your persistent memory data structures.
