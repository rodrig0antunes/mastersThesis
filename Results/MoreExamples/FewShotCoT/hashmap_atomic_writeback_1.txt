### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the areas of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the areas of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the first bug fix, the line 'POBJ_FREE(&D_RO(hashmap)->buckets);' is replaced with 'PMEMoid buckets_oid = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets.oid; POBJ_FREE(&buckets_oid);'. 
This change ensures that the correct OID is passed to the POBJ_FREE function, as the POBJ_FREE function expects a pointer to an OID, not a pointer to a TOID. 
By assigning the OID of the 'buckets' field to a separate variable 'buckets_oid' and passing that variable to POBJ_FREE, the bug is fixed.
In the second bug fix, the line 'PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets, D_RO(hashmap)->buckets_tmp);' is left unchanged. 
This line is responsible for updating the 'buckets' field of the 'hashmap' struct with the contents of the 'buckets_tmp' field. 
This update is necessary to complete the rebuild process.
