## Explanation
In the correction, the lines 'PM_EQU(leaf->key, 0);' and 'PM_EQU(leaf->slot, OID_NULL);' are replaced with 'leaf->key = 0;' and 'leaf->slot = OID_NULL;' respectively. 
The 'PM_EQU' macro is not a valid function or macro in the PMDK library. Instead, the correct way to assign values to the 'leaf->key' and 'leaf->slot' variables is to directly assign the values using the assignment operator '='. 
By making this correction, the program correctly assigns the value 0 to 'leaf->key' and OID_NULL to 'leaf->slot' within the transaction block, ensuring that the changes are properly recorded and persisted in the persistent memory pool.
