## Explanation
In the correction, the missing line 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(dest, sizeof(*dest));' is added before the assignment 'PM_EQU(*dest, D_RW(node)->entries[D_RO(node)->entries[0].key == leaf->key]);'. 
This line tells the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'dest' pointer during the transaction. It essentially registers 'dest' as a part of the transaction, making sure that if the transaction aborts, the changes to 'dest' are rolled back as well.
By adding 'pmemobj_tx_add_range_direct(dest, sizeof(*dest));', the transaction system ensures that the assignment to 'dest' is properly recorded. 
If the transaction is successful, this change will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, it will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of your persistent memory data structures.
