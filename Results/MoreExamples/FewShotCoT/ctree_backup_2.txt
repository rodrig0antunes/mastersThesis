### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the line 'PM_EQU(*dest, D_RW(node)->entries[D_RO(node)->entries[0].key == leaf->key]);' is replaced with 'PM_EQU(*dest, D_RW(node)->entries[D_RO(node)->entries[0].key != leaf->key]);'.
This change ensures that the correct entry is selected when swapping the parent internal node with the remaining node. The condition 'D_RO(node)->entries[0].key != leaf->key' selects the correct entry based on the key value of the leaf node.
