### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, each located in the area of the code delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the respective areas of the code delimited by the '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the bug fixes involve changing the incorrect use of the macro 'PM_EQU' to directly assign the value '1' to 'D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty' and '0' to 'D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty'.
Additionally, the calls to 'pmemobj_persist' are correctly placed after the updates to 'D_RW(hashmap)->count_dirty' and 'D_RW(hashmap)->count' to ensure that the changes are durably stored in persistent memory.
By making these changes, the program correctly updates the 'count_dirty' and 'count' variables and persists the changes in the correct order, ensuring data integrity in persistent memory.
