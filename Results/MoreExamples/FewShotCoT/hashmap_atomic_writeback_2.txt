### Corrected Persistent Memory Program
``` C
/*
 * hm_atomic_rebuild_finish -- finishes rebuild, assumes buckets_tmp is not null
 */
static void
hm_atomic_rebuild_finish(PMEMobjpool *pop, TOID(struct hashmap_atomic) hashmap)
{
	TOID(struct buckets) cur = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets;
	TOID(struct buckets) tmp = D_RO(hashmap)->buckets_tmp;

	for (size_t i = 0; i < D_RO(cur)->nbuckets; ++i) {
		while (!POBJ_LIST_EMPTY(&D_RO(cur)->bucket[i])) {
			TOID(struct entry) en =
					POBJ_LIST_FIRST(&D_RO(cur)->bucket[i]);
			uint64_t h = hash(&hashmap, &tmp, D_RO(en)->key);

			if (POBJ_LIST_MOVE_ELEMENT_HEAD(pop,
					&D_RW(cur)->bucket[i],
					&D_RW(tmp)->bucket[h],
					en, list, list)) {
				fprintf(stderr, "move failed: %s\n",

			sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets));

	 * We have to set offset manually instead of substituting OID_NULL,

### Explanation
In the original code, there are two bugs indicated by the "// BUG //" comments. 

1. The first bug is that the line `PM_EQU(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp.oid.off, 0);` is missing the `pmemobj_persist` call to ensure that the change is durably stored in persistent memory. To fix this, we need to add the line `pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp.oid.off, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp.oid.off));` after setting the offset to 0.

2. The second bug is that the line `pmemobj_persist(pop, &D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp, sizeof(D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp));` is commented out. This line is necessary to ensure that the changes made to `D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp` are durably stored in persistent memory. To fix this, we need to uncomment the line.

By making these corrections, the program will properly persist the changes made to `D_RW(hashmap)->buckets_tmp` and maintain data consistency in persistent memory.
