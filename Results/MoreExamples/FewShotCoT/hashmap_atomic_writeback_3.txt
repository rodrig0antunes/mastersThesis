### Corrected Persistent Memory Program

``` C

### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the areas of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 

#### Bug 1:
The first bug is fixed by adding a transaction block around the assignment of 'count_dirty' to 1. This ensures that the change to 'count_dirty' is properly recorded and persisted in the persistent memory pool. 

#### Bug 2:
The second bug is fixed by adding a transaction block around the increment of 'count' and the persistence of 'count'. This ensures that the increment of 'count' and the persistence of 'count' are performed atomically and consistently. 

By adding transaction blocks and using the appropriate transactional APIs, the changes made to the persistent memory data structures are properly recorded and persisted, ensuring data consistency and durability.
