## Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the transaction system is used to ensure the durability and consistency of the changes made to the persistent memory data structures.
For the first bug fix, 'TX_ADD_FIELD(parent, items[p]);' is added before the assignment 'PM_EQU(D_RW(parent)->items[p], D_RO(rsb)->items[0]);'. This line tells the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'items[p]' field of the 'parent' node during the transaction. It essentially registers 'items[p]' as a part of the transaction, making sure that if the transaction aborts, the changes to 'items[p]' are rolled back as well.
For the second bug fix, 'TX_ADD_FIELD(node, slots[D_RO(node)->n]);' is added before the assignment 'PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[D_RO(node)->n], D_RO(rsb)->slots[0]);'. This line tells the transaction system that it is intended to modify the 'slots[D_RO(node)->n]' field of the 'node' node during the transaction. It essentially registers 'slots[D_RO(node)->n]' as a part of the transaction, making sure that if the transaction aborts, the changes to 'slots[D_RO(node)->n]' are rolled back as well.
By adding these 'TX_ADD_FIELD' lines, the transaction system ensures that the assignments to 'items[p]' and 'slots[D_RO(node)->n]' are properly recorded. If the transaction is successful, these changes will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, they will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of the persistent memory data structures.
