## Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the first bug fix is to remove the line 'PM_EQU(D_RW(parent)->items[p], D_RO(rsb)->items[0]);'. This line is not necessary because the new separator is already inserted into the deficient node in the line above it.
The second bug fix is to remove the line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(node, slots[D_RO(node)->n]);'. This line is not necessary because the transaction system already knows that the 'slots' field of 'node' is being modified due to the previous line 'PM_EQU(D_RW(node)->slots[D_RO(node)->n], D_RO(rsb)->slots[0]);'.
By removing these two lines, the program will work correctly without any bugs.
