## Explanation
In the correction, two lines are added to the code to fix the bug. 
The first line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h], next);' is added to register the modification of the 'next' field of the 'entry' struct in the transaction. This ensures that if the transaction aborts, the changes to the 'next' field are rolled back as well.
The second line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(hashmap, count);' is added to register the modification of the 'count' field of the 'hashmap_tx' struct in the transaction. This ensures that if the transaction aborts, the changes to the 'count' field are rolled back as well.
By adding these two lines, the transaction system ensures that the modifications to the 'next' field and the 'count' field are properly recorded. If the transaction is successful, these changes will be committed, and if the transaction aborts, they will be rolled back, maintaining the consistency of your persistent memory data structures.
