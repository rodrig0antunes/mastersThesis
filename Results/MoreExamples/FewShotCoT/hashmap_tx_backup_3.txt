### CORRECTED PERSISTENT MEMORY PROGRAM

``` C
/*
 * hm_tx_insert -- inserts specified value into the hashmap,
 * returns:
 * - 0 if successful,
 * - 1 if value already existed,
 * - -1 if something bad happened
 */

### Explanation
In the example, there are two bugs to repair, located in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions. 
In the correction of the example, the bug fixes are put in the area of the code delimited by the two '// BUG //' expressions.
In the correction, the following changes are made:
1. The line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(buckets, bucket[h]);' is added to register the modification of the 'bucket[h]' field of the 'buckets' struct in the transaction.
2. The line 'TX_ADD_FIELD(hashmap, count);' is added to register the modification of the 'count' field of the 'hashmap' struct in the transaction.
3. The line 'PMTest_assign(&(D_RW(e)->key), sizeof(struct entry));' is removed as it is not necessary.
4. The lines 'PM_EQU((D_RW(e)->key), (key));', 'PM_EQU((D_RW(e)->value), (value));', and 'PM_EQU((D_RW(e)->next), (D_RO(buckets)->bucket[h]));' are removed as they are not necessary.
5. The line 'PM_EQU((D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h]), (e));' is replaced with 'D_RW(buckets)->bucket[h] = e;' to assign the new entry 'e' to the 'bucket[h]' field.
6. The line 'PM_EQU((D_RW(hashmap)->count), (D_RW(hashmap)->count+1));' is replaced with 'D_RW(hashmap)->count++;' to increment the count of the hashmap.
By making these changes, the bugs in the code are fixed, and the program should work as expected.
